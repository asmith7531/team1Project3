## Overview

*Main goal: to make the process of applying to college/university, technical schools, and certificate programs easier for people - especially those who may not have a clear idea of what career they want to pursue*

Applying to college can be a daunting process. Especially for the many young people who do not know what they want to do in terms of a career - and to no fault of their own! With economic uncertainty and an ever-changing job market, it can be overwhelming to weigh the countless work opportunities in the US. 

Our app is intended to help guide people towards a productive and fulfilling future. Users will be able to take a survey that assesses their strengths, weaknesses, and passions. From there we can recommend a course of action. 

Users will be able to access a general info page and search data on:
* College majors / programs
* Trade programs
* Certificate and work training programs
* Labor statistics on the above fields
* Income statistics on the above field
* Links to scholarships/grants

#### Why?
There does not appear to be any app that does what we aim to do: provide users with a one-stop tool to help them make one of the most important decisions of their lives. These services can be found spread across various apps, but we will be able to succinctly compile them in one place.
